https://xd.adobe.com/view/28004468-172c-41f8-6b22-b719d5d9b0d4-5e31

Here is a small guide on how to see the developer specs for the design file 
![Guide for specs](./design-specs-guide.gif)

## Task

Here is a list of things we want you to do; 

- Use html and scss to style the layout of the page and a non-dynamic sidebar
- Get the list of items from the mock server at `http://localhost:3000/items` show these items on the page
- Make the items searchable by title
- Indent the item based on the parent_id's in the list so it creates a tree stucture see design file where we indent based on where they are in the tree stucture

## Bonus points

- Write tests
- Make a sub page for the items so when you click the button you route to the sub page 
<br />(Note you can get single item by calling `http://localhost:3000/items/:id`)
- Make the layout responsive
