# Cobiro frontend test

What I could implement in this project:

1. Custom created CSS styles with use of CSS Grid and Flexbox only
2. Use of interfaces and services
3. RxJS
4. Search pipe
5. Working with data structure, creating a function which makes tree structure flat again in a right sequential order with depth calculation. NPM 'list-to-tree' being used for that. I may say that it was the most difficult part for me and the most time-consuming. The function is a pure JavaScript, but I would love to learn how to implement it with Typescript syntax in the future
6. Media queries for responsive layout.
7. Github commits, git
8. And surely significant Angular manipulations like style, data, property binding etc.

What I can also do, but did not implement in this project:
1. Responsive design for smartphones creating a toggle sidenav element
2. Data structure manipulations with Typescript, not JS
3. Make sub pages for items with routers

What I would like to learn how to use:
1. Unit tests
2. NodeJS
3. Adobe XD (the way UX Designers work are of great inspiration for me and having photography background I also would like to go deeper into styles and UX design).

Basically, the most exciting part for me was dealing with CSS styles, I can do it forever. Logic and data structure was the most complicated one, but it was a great opportunity to learn new things.
